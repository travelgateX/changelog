# TESTING FUNCTIONS

## Testing results
There are mainly two ways to see the output of a test:  
```
t.Error("The test has failed") 
```
and

```
t.Fatal("The test has failed")
```
The main difference between these two is that t.Fatal will stop the execution of the text. See this [link](https://blog.codeship.com/testing-in-go/) for an extended explanation of testing t. use.
